## Automation Return Of Investment

"App Description: iOS mobile application , pretty stable ( ~2 yr in prod ) but with fast changing functionality and big amount 3rd party services.
The best part for starting automation is Regeression because, it requires every 2 week ( every 2 weeks release schedule ) , covers basic funcionality, takes 16mhr and covers at least 2 devices. 
Automation would be good for project, especially for expanding on Android platform ( the same app ),  but customer doesn't have additional budgets for TA engineer. Period"
